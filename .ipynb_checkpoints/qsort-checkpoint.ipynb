    "# Recursion and Quicksort\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is the solution of problems by reducing to smaller instances of similar problems. We have seen an instance of this with the _Tower of Hanoi_. Another instance is the _quick-sort_ algorithm for sortin a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given a list of distinct integers, which we need to sort into ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the list has less than 2 elements, it is already sorted.\n",
    "* Suppose we have a list with at least two elements, for example `[197,86,23,119,56,175,135,149,132,166,33,77,27,44,53,162]`.\n",
    "* We pick a random element of the list, the _pivot_. For example `132` in the above list.\n",
    "* We construct two lists: _elements below the pivot_ and _elements above the pivot_, for example `[86,23,119,56,33,77,27,44,53]` and `[197,175,135,149,166,162]` in the above.\n",
    "* We use _quick sort_ recursively to sort the two lists, getting `[23,27,33,44,53,56,77,86,119]` and `[135,149,162,166,175,197]`\n",
    "* The sorted list is the first list, followed by the pivot, followed by the second list: `[23,27,33,44,53,56,77,86,119,132,135,149,162,166,175,197]`\n"
